    <h2>Hello world!</h2>
    <p>
      In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from
      perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. They're like sex, except I'm
      having them! And when we woke up, we had these bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tell them I hate them. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us
      trust you? It must be wonderful. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?
      <strong> What's with you kids?</strong>
      <em> Every other day it's food, food, food.</em> Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.

      Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were
      actually wriggling through them.

      The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you
      can make your bed in your sleep. It doesn't look so shiny to me. The alien mothership is in
      orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of
      cards. Checkmate.

        That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love
        anyone pretending to be him!

        Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that
        panders to my lust for violence?
      </li>
      <li>With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!</li>

      Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! When the lights go out, it's nobody's
      business what goes on between two consenting adults. I haven't felt much of anything since my
      guinea pig died. You're going to do his laundry?

      <li>Can I use the gun?</li>
      <li>
        Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your
        good vestments."
      </li>
      <li>You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?</li>
